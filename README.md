I'm Chiranthan aka WickedWizard3588. I go by the name WickedWizard3588 on most platforms :)

I am currently learning Javascript and C.

I also have a repository on [`YAGPDB.xyz`](https://yagpdb.xyz/) CC's, check them [here](https://github.com/WickedWizard3588/YAGPDB-CC)

# Tech

I mostly use [`VSC/VSCode`](https://code.visualstudio.com/), also with [`Github`](https://github.com/).

# Projects I'm working on

<details>
    <summary>Xyborg</summary>
    <br>
    Xyborg, a multi-functional Discord Bot I'm working on. It is still in Beta Stage and not even halfway completed. Around 15 commands, including Owner Only ones. You can invite it [here](https://dsc.gg/invitexyborg). You can find the Support Server [here](https://dsc.gg/xyborg)
    </br>
</details>

That's the only Bot I'm working on right now, and in my Free Time, I usually make some YAGPDB.xyz CC's as mentioned above
