    <summary>Xyborg</summary>
    <br>
    Xyborg, a multi-functional Discord Bot I'm working on. It is still in Beta Stage and not even halfway completed. Around 15 commands, including Owner Only ones. You can invite it <a href = "https://dsc.gg/invitexyborg" target = "_blank">here</a> and find the Support Server <a href = "https://dsc.gg/xyborg" target = "_blank">here</a>.
